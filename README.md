# Customer-Churn-Prediction

This project predicts customer churn (whether a customer will leave or stay) using machine learning models on the Telco Customer Churn dataset. <br>
 <br>
It also includes an interactive dashboard where users can upload their own CSV files and instantly get churn predictions <br>
 <br>

#Project Overview <br>
 <br>
Customer churn is a major challenge in subscription-based businesses. The goal of this project is to build models that can classify whether a customer is likely to churn based on their demographics, services, and payment methods. <br>

Key highlights: <br>

-Data preprocessing (handling categorical variables, missing values, and encoding). <br>

-Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers. <br>

-Compared models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. <br>

-Built a Python-based Dashboard for real-time predictions on user-provided datasets. <br>
